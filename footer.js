/*
Insert any lines of HTML content you want at the bottom (footer)
of each web page.  Each line must be in the form of a document.write
statement, with double-quoted contents, terminated with a semicolon, such as:

	document.write("<p align=\"center\">Copyright &copy; John Doe 2011</p>");

Note, as in the example above, that you must escape any double-quote characters
(by preceding each with a backslash character) that are part of the content
you are including.

The document.write lines can include either simple text or text along
with HTML tags (as in the example above).

You may include as many document.write lines as you want. An empty one
is shown below, as an example. */

document.write("");
